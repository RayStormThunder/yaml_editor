2.2.0

New Minor Feature:
-Rows and List Values can now be different colors depending on their state
-Green means that you changed the value of that row in this session.
-Blue means the value of a row is different from the value of that row in the template file.
-Yellow means that it is a row or value that was added by you manually.
-You can disable these colors with buttons at the top

Made two small changes:
-The YAML list now updates based on changes in the amount of items in a folder, not last modified date
-Putting a number (1-9) as the first character of a datapackage gives that priority

Bug Fixes:
-Fixed a bug where hitting the 'move' button didn't reapply the filter
-Fixed a bug where if you loaded a yaml with an item in a dictionary, that item would not be in the excluded list
-Fixed a bug where removing one item in the included list when you had multiple would remove all of them



2.1.1

Bug Fix:
-Fixed an issue where a game name with a disallowed character for window's files and folders would fail to create the files or folders. Any such characters will be replaced by a tilda '~'



2.1.0

Minor Features:
-The program no longer contains any datapackages
-The program now automatically will extract/update the supported datapackages from archipelago on first run and when archipelago updates
-Extracting an unsupported game's datapackage will include the groups allowing for filtering
-The Setting Description field when a yaml is not loaded will be bigger and give information on how to use the program

Serious Bug Fixes:
-Fixed a bug where loading a weighted option yaml would keep the default value for the option regardless of what the yaml said

Backend changes:
-Pulling the supported datapackage will check for an update via GitHub tags before pulling data
-Pulling a datpackage via connecting to a multiworld will only request a datapackage if it's checksum is different from the current one

-The version number in the window title will be set automatically



2.0.2

Fixed a serious bug and added two small changes:
Fixed a bug where the 'gui_data.json' was being saved in incorrect place. This caused issues such as
-The program would not remember your last loaded yaml
-Adding items to the lists with the Add/Remove button would not be remembered
-Your 'Enter Weighted Option Mode' setting would not be remembered per yaml file
-Your 'Hide Setting Description' setting would not be remembered

Made two changes:
-Search text is now matched to every item in a combobox, not just the currently selected item
-The custom theme will be applied to people using light theme, not just windows 10 users

Fixes various bugs with the program:
-Fixed a bug where having a template yaml not be called, "{game}.yaml" would cause loading issues
-Fixed a bug where the "YAML" section would not auto update it's yamls
-Imported Websockets to actually allow server connections for datapackage extraction purposes
-The "Save" and "Load" buttons have been moved down to make the "Save" button always accessible
-The "Save" button now actually shows in real time what the file's name will save as
-Greatly improved UI for Windows 10 and Light Mode Users (By forcing dark mode :P)



2.0.0

This update completely reworks the entire program.
To start using, start the program in a new folder. Then place template yamls in the YAMLS folder.
If you have any previous yamls, add those to their respective folders that should appear when you add the template yaml.

Features:
- You can now do modify Weights of your settings
- The Description is now right of the options in the general tab and can be hidden
- You can now search the General Tab
- You can now filter a list by exclusion instead of on inclusion
- For undefined lists you can set if they should have items, locations or custom by default
- You can now add or remove items from lists. These will be remembered per game
- You can now load yamls in the UI
- You can now use any game's yaml

Datapackage Retrival
You can now extract the datapackage by doing the following:

- Start an AP Seed with the game you want in it
- Make sure you don't have a yaml loaded in your yaml_editor
- Insert the slot name into the slot field
- Insert the game name into the game field
- Insert the server address into the description field
- Click the Save YAML button
- This will join that room, extract the datapackage from each game, and disconnect you
